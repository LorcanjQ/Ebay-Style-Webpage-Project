# Ebay-Style-Webpage-Project
"Ebay" style Auctions project completed in the Python-Django Framework. I have done a youtube video including a voiceover which outlines the main features of the website
Video: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI 
Below i have listed the main features of the website, along with a timestamp to where each feature can be seen in the video.

1. Create a new user: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=4​
  This added a new user and details to the database, as well as giving an error message if the user already existed
2. Create a new  listing: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=20​
  New listing being created meant it had its own webpage. Each Listing gives details as to when it was created, who created it, when the last bid was made, etc
3. Listing page: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=42​
4. Listing now on "active listings page" https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=44​
  Each listing created is included as an item in the "active listings" page, into which it could be clicked into.
5. More than one listing on "active listings page" https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=80​
6. Add listing to "favourites": https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=121​
  Each user can add the listing to their favourites, which can be accessed by clicking into "watchlist". They can also remove from favourites accordingly
7. Remove listing from favourites: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=134​
8. Add comment to listing : https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=153​
  Users can comment on listings, details such as user name and comment posting time are included in the comments.
9. Place a bid: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=180​
  If bid placed is too low, error message is produced. If bid placed is correct, page is changed such that most recent bid, and price of item, have been acknowledged
10. Terminate listing and accept bid: https://youtu.be/-8u6D07MOgI?t=238
  The user who originally set up the listing can decide to close the listing at any times, which automatically declares the user with the highest bid as the winner
